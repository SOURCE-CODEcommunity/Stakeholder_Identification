Companies across various industries rely on online courses to teach workers how to perform tasks ensuring quality, safety, and compliance with regulations and the firm's code of conduct. Many organizations struggle with eLearning courses stored in outdated formats, which fail to deliver desired learning outcomes. These formats range from text and PowerPoint files to SCORM files used in Learning Management Systems (LMS). Revamping outdated learning formats requires hiring third-party content creators for digital 3D environments, with LMS providers advising on pedagogy. This is a tedious and costly process that is affordable only for select courses, not entire catalogs. Transforming Corporate Training with AI-Powered eLearning Solutions Research shows that online learning with animations, avatars, and gamification is more flexible, cost-effective, and personalized than traditional methods. Companies report higher employee engagement, retention rates , increased revenue, and productivity , while reducing costs on instructors, equipment, and travel. AI's ability to quickly structure information revolutionizes eLearning by enabling content personalization, faster animation rendering, and new interactive features like voice discussions, enhancing the overall effectiveness of online learning. Most large global organizations already offer eLearning courses to enhance employee knowledge and operations, and due to the demonstrated effectiveness, many plan to further improve courses and learning outcomes using AI tools . That’s where We Are comes in; to help corporations bring their eLearning to life.

For decades, many educators and software developers have been pursuing the vision of a high-quality, affordable education delivered through technology, to varying degrees of success. Surprisingly, the amount of money spent on digital education in the U.S. still makes up a minuscule sliver of most state and school budgets, which are shrinking and famously tangled in bureaucracy. By comparison, w e’re running behind countries like India and China. In China, online education is a $50+ billion industry, according to Deloitte, and is projected to more than triple in the next three years. Meanwhile, in the U.S. COVID has brought renewed urgency to the mission to make our education system more digital and accessible. For many teachers and parents, the status quo—Zoomed-out kids passively watching teacher lectures—is sorely lacking. Today, a new wave of edtech companies is taking cues from gaming, entertainment, and abroad to reinvent the experience of online education entirely. If the past was marked by massive onscreen lectures, static, pre-recorded content, and a limited pool of teachers, the future of education technology will be consumer- and product-led: interactive, engaging, and propelled by a global pool of instructors and peers. While previous generations of edtech largely focused on in-school content distribution, more recently founders have turned their attention to after-school and out-of-school education. There’s a lot left to build. We believe post-COVID online education will differ from the past in key ways. Background and drivers Though edtech has been decades in the making, founder philosophies have shifted over the years. The first wave of modern edtech was dominated by MOOCs: free online courses, often in partnership with leading universities and professors, that anyone could enroll in from anywhere in the world to learn at their own pace. In the next phase, many founders built tools and resources for schools that were supplementary to in-person educators. In the current phase, many edtech founders have shifted their focus to after-school and out-of-school supplemental learning. While some would argue that YouTube has become an online school in its own right, there’s huge opportunity to offer curated, high quality, live educational experiences. Many parents are taking an increasingly pronounced role in the academic experience, and we’ve seen the emergence of new platforms for supplemental education and homeschooling. In addition, edtech companies are tackling areas that have often been overlooked or underserved by public school budgets, such as the arts, sports, study abroad opportunities, technology literacy, and vocational skills. Of course, the hurdles to modernizing our education system at scale are significant. Prior to COVID, edtech companies largely sold to schools, with mixed results. There are many reasons the B2B model didn’t penetrate—a misalignment of stakeholders (not to mention the many degrees of separation between the buyers and the actual teachers), dispersed financial decision-makers, and long sales cycles among them. But the primary reason selling to schools didn’t catch on more widely? Funding . That shortfall amplified by COVID-19. Public K-12 schools are funded mostly by state governments, and state revenues have been drastically impacted by recent business shutdowns: This spring, New York schools received a temporary budget reduction of 20 percent ; Colorado plans to spend 15 percent less on education next year . Georgia cut its education budget by $950 million , and Ohio by $300 million amid the recent economic fallout. Public schools’ budget limitations have created a surge in alternative avenues of education, for those who can access them: private schools, homeschooling, and supplemental education. Edtech companies targeting this market combine software and online distribution to help make teachers’ jobs easier and learning more engaging. Six ways post-COVID edtech will differ from the past The latest wave on online education companies builds on previous efforts in key ways: Parents cut through red tape While educators around the country adapt to the challenges of virtual classrooms, many parents have become increasingly involved in their kids’ education—whether out of enthusiasm or necessity. According to a July Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents with children in grades K-12, 51 percent report spending more on internet-based learning resources such as virtual tutors, subscriptions to e-learning platforms, and online classes. Edtech companies have also introduced a variety of business models to cater to neighborhood-based or remote education “pods,” from monthly subscriptions to class packs to a-la-carte lesson marketplaces. These solutions often focus on small-group, project-based learning and cover subjects beyond the usual standardized testing curriculum. In addition, the increased role of parents in their kids’ education during COVID has led to the rise of “flipped” classrooms, in which students are introduced to content at home by parents and then practice applying it at school (instead of the other way around). While present in the past, these methods are rapidly becoming more prevalent. Teachers will be free agents Edtech platforms give everyone access to the most talented, experienced, and innovative teachers, unconstrained by geography (or public school salary caps). On new and established platforms like Teachers Pay Teachers , Padlet , and Numerade , educators across the country can share and collaborate with one another on the best resources and methods for a particular topic, rather than following a pre-established playbook. Teachers Pay Teachers is a marketplace for teachers to buy and sell resources for any subject area and grade level, from lesson plans to presentations. Padlet is a digital multimedia whiteboard where teachers can showcase content—be it YouTube videos, websites, text, or their own audio clips—that can then be saved, shared, or commented on. And on Numerade, educators provide step-by-step explainer videos for high-school and college-level STEM problems. Where these types of activities were possible in the past, there is more depth and optionality to online marketplaces than ever before. Parents can seek out the best instructors for specific topics—tailored to the needs of each individual child. Kids get access to a wider variety of learning resources and teaching styles. And educators are less constrained in their curriculums (previously defined rigidly only by districts) and can share and monetize their talents with a wider audience. These models can also expand the talent pool of instructors and assortment of subjects taught: on the supplemental education marketplace Outschool , for instance, anyone with expertise can create a class. MOOCs get a makeover Massive open online courses, or MOOCs, have been decades in the making. And while they’re adept at distributing content widely, MOOCs have been plagued by low completion rates. The next iteration of one-to-many lessons will be more community-based, “gamified,” and interactive. Through the next generation of Bill Nyes—on platforms like Age of Learning (ABC Mouse), Mystery.org, and Tappity—kids can interact with teachers through choose-your-own-adventure-style lessons. This element of personal agency helps hold kids’ attention and makes them feel like they’re part of the journey. In addition, live group educational experiences featuring cartoon characters are on the rise: ZipSchool offers after-school, STEM-focused live experiences, while Tiny Broadway focuses on the performing arts. The large group, community-based approach also extends to high school test prep. The livestreaming test prep platform Fiveable , for instance, was founded by a successful advanced placement teacher in Oakland, California. Now AP teachers around the country conduct live sessions on the platform with thousands of students in attendance. While one-to-many online teaching is by no means new, modern platforms are harnessing technology to make learning increasingly interactive. Students are incentivized to engage with both the subject matter and the community. Math meets Minecraft (and Mickey) Entertainment and kid culture is creeping into all aspects of education, beyond just “for kids.” One example is EduHam, an educational program spun off the hit Broadway show, which launched a fully virtual experience that guides students through the Hamilton creation process. At the conclusion, students create and perform their own musical theatre pieces. In a similar vein, iPad-based Osmo draws on Mickey Mouse and Disney princesses to teach kids lessons in coding, drawing, and math. But unlike the animated educational games of the past, these meld the digital with the tactile, combining an interactive video experience with physical word and number tiles, coding blocks, tangrams, and more. Taking the trend a step further, companies like Legends of Learning create educational games to teach STEM subjects and offer real-time analytics on student performance. The aim is twofold: to make learning more fun and give teachers deeper insight into student comprehension and retention. Legends of Learning uses educational games to teach K-8 STEM concepts. YouTube gets unbundled Through user-generated videos, YouTube pioneered a popular online educational format— half of YouTube users have used the platform for learning purposes, and a third of parents let their kids watch YouTube regularly, making it more ubiquitous than many edtech platforms and tools. Now, verticalized startups are carving off niche subjects to provide a variety of learning styles for various interests and budgets. Sora ’s personalized curriculums meld live and independent learning and are driven by individual student curiosities, such as planetary science or multicultural literature. Juni Learning creates high-quality curriculums on subjects like coding and computer science, while CodeWizards provides both live online coding classes and internship matching. Platforms like Primer and Prisma focus on project- and application-based learning for at-home schooling. In many cases, online curricula is becoming more narrowly focused and tailored to students’ specific interests and learning styles. These platforms strive to make connections outside the classroom to boost relevancy and retention. Software frees teachers from after-school drudgery AI isn’t coming for teachers’ jobs—it’s coming for their busywork. A range of companies are working on tools to assist with in-person teaching and classroom management, allowing teachers more time on the high-value activities: lesson planning and teaching. Single-sign in platform Clever enables instructors to access all their teaching apps and tech resources, providing a secure pipe to school district data and applications. Companies like ClassDojo , Remind , and Edmodo help teachers to build better classroom communities through awards, incentives, and increased parent-teacher communication. Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams allow teachers to digitally manage homework submissions that previously had to be printed, hauled back and forth to school, and manually tracked. Paper is a 24/7 educational assistance chat line for students to get tutoring on-demand. This segment of edtech isn’t solely about content, it’s also about software-enabled tools that work to streamline teachers’ mountain of tasks, beyond instruction. * * * Many parents, students, and instructors have struggled—and continue to struggle—with the abrupt transition to remote learning spurred by COVID. But we are optimistic that through the work of talented teachers, entrepreneurs, and technologists, we’ll emerge from this pandemic with significantly better tools and resources for online learning than ever before. The virtual classrooms of the future will have classroom-specific features, rather than using general video conferencing software. Thanks to advances in software, AI, livestreaming, and video tools, we believe this generation of edtech platforms will be more engaging, interactive, and accessible than the past. There’s still a lot of opportunity to build in this space. We’re excited to meet the new wave of edtech founders. Want more a16z Consumer?

On new and established platforms like Teachers Pay Teachers , Padlet , and Numerade , educators across the country can share and collaborate with one another on the best resources and methods for a particular topic, rather than following a pre-established playbook. Teachers Pay Teachers is a marketplace for teachers to buy and sell resources for any subject area and grade level, from lesson plans to presentations. Padlet is a digital multimedia whiteboard where teachers can showcase content—be it YouTube videos, websites, text, or their own audio clips—that can then be saved, shared, or commented on. And on Numerade, educators provide step-by-step explainer videos for high-school and college-level STEM problems. Where these types of activities were possible in the past, there is more depth and optionality to online marketplaces than ever before. Parents can seek out the best instructors for specific topics—tailored to the needs of each individual child. Kids get access to a wider variety of learning resources and teaching styles. And educators are less constrained in their curriculums (previously defined rigidly only by districts) and can share and monetize their talents with a wider audience. These models can also expand the talent pool of instructors and assortment of subjects taught: on the supplemental education marketplace Outschool , for instance, anyone with expertise can create a class. MOOCs get a makeover Massive open online courses, or MOOCs, have been decades in the making. And while they’re adept at distributing content widely, MOOCs have been plagued by low completion rates. The next iteration of one-to-many lessons will be more community-based, “gamified,” and interactive. Through the next generation of Bill Nyes—on platforms like Age of Learning (ABC Mouse), Mystery.org, and Tappity—kids can interact with teachers through choose-your-own-adventure-style lessons. This element of personal agency helps hold kids’ attention and makes them feel like they’re part of the journey. In addition, live group educational experiences featuring cartoon characters are on the rise: ZipSchool offers after-school, STEM-focused live experiences, while Tiny Broadway focuses on the performing arts. The large group, community-based approach also extends to high school test prep. The livestreaming test prep platform Fiveable , for instance, was founded by a successful advanced placement teacher in Oakland, California. Now AP teachers around the country conduct live sessions on the platform with thousands of students in attendance. While one-to-many online teaching is by no means new, modern platforms are harnessing technology to make learning increasingly interactive. Students are incentivized to engage with both the subject matter and the community. Math meets Minecraft (and Mickey) Entertainment and kid culture is creeping into all aspects of education, beyond just “for kids.” One example is EduHam, an educational program spun off the hit Broadway show, which launched a fully virtual experience that guides students through the Hamilton creation process. At the conclusion, students create and perform their own musical theatre pieces. In a similar vein, iPad-based Osmo draws on Mickey Mouse and Disney princesses to teach kids lessons in coding, drawing, and math. But unlike the animated educational games of the past, these meld the digital with the tactile, combining an interactive video experience with physical word and number tiles, coding blocks, tangrams, and more. Taking the trend a step further, companies like Legends of Learning create educational games to teach STEM subjects and offer real-time analytics on student performance. The aim is twofold: to make learning more fun and give teachers deeper insight into student comprehension and retention. Legends of Learning uses educational games to teach K-8 STEM concepts. YouTube gets unbundled Through user-generated videos, YouTube pioneered a popular online educational format— half of YouTube users have used the platform for learning purposes, and a third of parents let their kids watch YouTube regularly, making it more ubiquitous than many edtech platforms and tools. Now, verticalized startups are carving off niche subjects to provide a variety of learning styles for various interests and budgets. Sora ’s personalized curriculums meld live and independent learning and are driven by individual student curiosities, such as planetary science or multicultural literature. Juni Learning creates high-quality curriculums on subjects like coding and computer science, while CodeWizards provides both live online coding classes and internship matching. Platforms like Primer and Prisma focus on project- and application-based learning for at-home schooling. In many cases, online curricula is becoming more narrowly focused and tailored to students’ specific interests and learning styles. These platforms strive to make connections outside the classroom to boost relevancy and retention. Software frees teachers from after-school drudgery AI isn’t coming for teachers’ jobs—it’s coming for their busywork. A range of companies are working on tools to assist with in-person teaching and classroom management, allowing teachers more time on the high-value activities: lesson planning and teaching. Single-sign in platform Clever enables instructors to access all their teaching apps and tech resources, providing a secure pipe to school district data and applications. Companies like ClassDojo , Remind , and Edmodo help teachers to build better classroom communities through awards, incentives, and increased parent-teacher communication. Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams allow teachers to digitally manage homework submissions that previously had to be printed, hauled back and forth to school, and manually tracked. Paper is a 24/7 educational assistance chat line for students to get tutoring on-demand. This segment of edtech isn’t solely about content, it’s also about software-enabled tools that work to streamline teachers’ mountain of tasks, beyond instruction. * * * Many parents, students, and instructors have struggled—and continue to struggle—with the abrupt transition to remote learning spurred by COVID. But we are optimistic that through the work of talented teachers, entrepreneurs, and technologists, we’ll emerge from this pandemic with significantly better tools and resources for online learning than ever before. The virtual classrooms of the future will have classroom-specific features, rather than using general video conferencing software. Thanks to advances in software, AI, livestreaming, and video tools, we believe this generation of edtech platforms will be more engaging, interactive, and accessible than the past. There’s still a lot of opportunity to build in this space. We’re excited to meet the new wave of edtech founders. Want more a16z Consumer?

and Learning through AI By AI Time Journal Editorial Staff / Updated February 13, 2023 Official Announcement The AI for Education 2019 Initiative Committee has completed the evaluations of prominent EdTech companies applying Artificial Intelligence to enhance education and learning. The companies selected in the list apply AI in different ways to benefit students, learners, and the educational sector at large. The fact that many students are finding it increasingly difficult to learn, the idea of artificial intelligence is equal to rescuing from a drowning boat. The level of education is reaching heights, which means that students are now required to put more effort, more knowledge, and more time into these tasks. But as the level of education rises, so do the services that help students with these tasks. Using the example of paperwriter reviews , which describe the benefits of the service, you can choose the most appropriate one. There are many of them, each one is good in its own way, specializes in different aspects, and they can be useful for students and the entire education sector in general. The evaluation is part of the AI for Education 2019 Initiative , which aims to identify and showcase the most impactful and beneficial applications\xa0of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Education. AI for Education Committee Members We thank the AI for Education 2019 Initiative Committee Members who took part in the evaluations. They have evaluated the EdTech companies based on their vision,\xa0the maturity of their technology, and their contribution to applying AI technology to solve significant problems in the educational sector. 10 EdTech Companies Enhancing Education and Learning through AI Scratch is a platform for student to create their own interactive stories.

Quill is a nonprofit educational organization that aims to increase the literacy and writing skill of people by more than just teaching about grammar. They develop adaptive research based on writing instruction that helps students to exercise writing and revise. They believe that writing is one important skill for the success of the future. Workbench is an education platform that provides students with featured resources of lessons for every student. They are now partnering with Google making it easier to sync data between Workbench and Google Classroom. Students can be assigned a project, lesson, or any other material related to the subject accordingly, and the teacher can track their progress within one platform. Blippar specializes in augmented reality (AR) and Computer vision (AI) technologies to make engaging and personalized experiences. Wonder Workshop is an educative platform that enables kids to learn coding from a very young age. Through a robot developed by Wonder Workshop, kids will discover a wonderful moment where parents will observe it as a ‘wonder moment’ of learning directly. With this interface, they try to make learning and discovering more fun for kids. Classcraft is reimagining the classroom with technology. They use games, technology, and storytelling method to make kids feel school as a place that is more playful and collaborative thus making the classroom situation better. With their product, Classcraft fosters a non-circular cognition of the student to help them prepare the future life as an adult. Knewton helps people and organizations to develop skills they need to advance in order to succeed. They fill in the gap in any level of education by developing digital education, learning assessment, and certification solutions to ensure enhanced education. Special Mention Squirrel AI Companies, where evaluating committee members’ work, have not been included in the evaluations. However, we want to highlight the work being done in the educational sector by Squirrel AI. Thought Leadership comment by Committee Member Dr.Premlatha KR Century is one of the best EdTech platforms for International schools (individual education plans for all children). Century ensures evidence-based scientific and pedagogical techniques in its products. Nowadays, international schools are trying to differentiate their classrooms from others. They use CENTURY AI in different ways, from an effective classroom learning platform to a homework tool. CENTURY’s new Pop-up AI Classroom provides a personalized learning path for all students. Wonder Workshop is one of the finest 10 EdTech companies learning through AI. It uses Robots, to trigger the creativity of kids and provide learning space to obtain critical coding skills. These Robots afford fun and interactive learning experiences for small kids. Recently, this EdTech Company launched its new product, Class Connect. It offers tutors, a dashboard to monitor students’ progress, understand where the students are succeeding and struggling in real-time, and determine the precise learning standards and resources. Kidaptive’s Adaptive Learning Platform uses AI technologies that support schools to collect learners’ data and improve learners’ commitment. Students were analyzed based on their strengths and weaknesses, and predictions were made about their future performance based on current learning patterns. Recently, I came across the wonderful EdTech website named WhiteHat Jr on social media sites. WhiteHat Jr makes 6-14 age group kids learn fundamentals of AI coding, logic, structure, sequence, and algorithmic thinking. In addition, they prepare them to generate creative animations and apps. Trends of AI in EdTech Currently, EdTech Companies are trying to automate the educational process wherever manual intervention is more required (creating assignments, setting questions, evaluation, performance assessment, etc…). AI Educational Chatbots are the better way to implement all these things (can serve as a tutor; serve counselors to guide students, make an inquiry, collect feedback and analyze results, etc…). AI enables the EdTech domain to change the one-size-fits-all model of classrooms and ensures personalized and collaborative learning. AI brings essential improvements in EdTech in terms of Adaptive e-learning , Online learning platforms , and recommender systems. Besides the above-discussed areas, there are some other EdTech platforms that are also doing well and going to dominate in the next decade. null Share via: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook About The Author AI Time Journal Editorial Staff The mission of AI Time Journal is to divulge information\r\nand knowledge\xa0about Artificial Intelligence, the changes that\r\nare coming and new opportunities to use AI technology to\r\nbenefit humanity.

What is an AI Video Generator and How Does It Work? Source: Synthesia.io digital avatars An AI video generator is a sophisticated software tool that leverages artificial intelligence to create, edit, and enhance video content. These innovative platforms utilize generative AI algorithms to analyze various inputs such as text, images, and existing video clips to produce engaging video content. By automating the video creation process, AI video generators allow users to create videos with minimal effort and time, making them an invaluable resource for both amateur and professional video creators. What is a Digital Avatar? A digital avatar is a computer-generated representation of a person, often used to deliver content in a lifelike, engaging manner. Digital avatars can be highly realistic, replicating facial expressions, body language, and speech, making them ideal for creating personalized video content. Many AI video generator tools, such as Heygen and Synthesia, allow you to create digital avatars starting from the picture of a real person. This means that when you create a video, the avatar is animated to speak and move just like the actual person, giving the illusion of a real person presenting your content. These avatars can be customized to match your brand's tone and style, and they can even speak in multiple languages, making them a versatile tool for educators. With digital avatars, educators can create relatable, visually engaging video lessons that feel more personal to students, making the learning experience more impactful and interactive. What Are the Benefits of Using AI Video Generators for Educators? AI video generators are incredibly beneficial for educators who want to make the learning experience more engaging and accessible. Here are some of the key benefits of using AI video generators in education: Create Quality Videos Without Video Editing or Design Skills No experience in video editing or design? No problem. AI video generators allow educators to create high-quality videos without needing to outsource a production team. All you need are raw materials such as images, scripts, or audio, and AI video tools can help you generate a polished video featuring either human-like avatars or faceless content. This means educators can produce instructional videos to support their lessons without the need for technical expertise. Enhance Video Content Production Capabilities Did you know that AI can generate a video in less than five minutes? Traditional video production can be time-consuming and costly, often requiring a team of individuals to complete. With AI video generator tools, all you need is a script and an idea. Instead of producing just a few videos a week, educators can create a larger volume of content in a fraction of the time, significantly enhancing their teaching resources. Produce Professional Videos at a Low Cost There's no need to hire an entire production crew and spend thousands of dollars to create high-quality educational videos. Many AI video generators cost between $15 and $30 per month, making them an affordable option for schools, universities, and individual educators. This cost-effective solution allows educators to create professional-looking videos, including avatars that can speak multiple languages, helping make content accessible to diverse student audiences. Incorporating AI video tools into the classroom allows educators to bring lessons to life and improve student engagementâ\x80\x94all while saving time and resources.

What is an AI Video Generator and How Does It Work? Source: Synthesia.io digital avatars An AI video generator is a sophisticated software tool that leverages artificial intelligence to create, edit, and enhance video content. These innovative platforms utilize generative AI algorithms to analyze various inputs such as text, images, and existing video clips to produce engaging video content. By automating the video creation process, AI video generators allow users to create videos with minimal effort and time, making them an invaluable resource for both amateur and professional video creators. What is a Digital Avatar? A digital avatar is a computer-generated representation of a person, often used to deliver content in a lifelike, engaging manner. Digital avatars can be highly realistic, replicating facial expressions, body language, and speech, making them ideal for creating personalized video content. Many AI video generator tools, such as Heygen and Synthesia, allow you to create digital avatars starting from the picture of a real person. This means that when you create a video, the avatar is animated to speak and move just like the actual person, giving the illusion of a real person presenting your content. These avatars can be customized to match your brand's tone and style, and they can even speak in multiple languages, making them a versatile tool for educators. With digital avatars, educators can create relatable, visually engaging video lessons that feel more personal to students, making the learning experience more impactful and interactive. What Are the Benefits of Using AI Video Generators for Educators? AI video generators are incredibly beneficial for educators who want to make the learning experience more engaging and accessible. Here are some of the key benefits of using AI video generators in education: Create Quality Videos Without Video Editing or Design Skills No experience in video editing or design? No problem. AI video generators allow educators to create high-quality videos without needing to outsource a production team. All you need are raw materials such as images, scripts, or audio, and AI video tools can help you generate a polished video featuring either human-like avatars or faceless content. This means educators can produce instructional videos to support their lessons without the need for technical expertise. Enhance Video Content Production Capabilities Did you know that AI can generate a video in less than five minutes? Traditional video production can be time-consuming and costly, often requiring a team of individuals to complete. With AI video generator tools, all you need is a script and an idea. Instead of producing just a few videos a week, educators can create a larger volume of content in a fraction of the time, significantly enhancing their teaching resources. Produce Professional Videos at a Low Cost There's no need to hire an entire production crew and spend thousands of dollars to create high-quality educational videos. Many AI video generators cost between $15 and $30 per month, making them an affordable option for schools, universities, and individual educators. This cost-effective solution allows educators to create professional-looking videos, including avatars that can speak multiple languages, helping make content accessible to diverse student audiences. Incorporating AI video tools into the classroom allows educators to bring lessons to life and improve student engagementâ\x80\x94all while saving time and resources.

These advanced AI features can help in trimming video clips, adjusting audio levels, and even enhancing visual elements based on AI analytics. By streamlining the video editing workflow, users can focus more on the creative aspects of video production rather than getting bogged down by technical details. This efficiency allows creators to produce more content in less time while maintaining high standards of quality. Using AI Avatars and AI Voices in Your Videos Incorporating AI avatars and AI voices into your videos can elevate the overall production quality and audience engagement. AI avatars can represent characters or presenters in video content, providing a relatable and dynamic element that resonates with viewers. Similarly, realistic AI voices can narrate scripts, ensuring that the audio complements the visuals seamlessly. These AI-generated components not only enhance storytelling but also make it easier for creators to produce diverse video content that appeals to a broad audience. Conclusion Video creation is now easier, faster, and cheaper due to the power of Artificial Intelligence. Anyone, with or without the skill of video editing and design, could produce several professional videos in a week. This is the future of video content creation .

Project Description: Colleague AI is creating an innovative educational platform that focuses on transforming middle-grade mathematics instruction by integrating artificial intelligence into the lesson planning process. The project aims to enhance teacher productivity and reduce workload stress while ensuring high-quality, inclusive mathematical instruction for grades 6-8. Through AI-powered tools like Claire AI, developed with mathematics educators and researchers, we support teachers by streamlining lesson planning and helping teachers adapt instructional materials to meet diverse student needs. The platform leverages semantic search, recommender systems, and content generation capabilities to help teachers modify and create engaging mathematics lessons. By focusing specifically on middle-grade mathematics, where content complexity increases and teacher support is crucial, Colleague AI helps ensure materials maintain mathematical accuracy while supporting different learning styles and ability levels. This integration of educational expertise with AI technology aims to address the unique challenges of middle-grade mathematics instruction. The platform supports teachers in creating research-based, standards-aligned lessons while reducing preparation time, particularly benefiting early-career teachers and those serving diverse student populations. Through this focused approach, Colleague AI works to improve both teaching effectiveness and student mathematical achievement. Challenges Related to AI Use in Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: In our experience implementing AI solutions in middle-grade math education, two \xa0significant challenges emerge in applying AI to mathematics education. First, general-purpose AI tools often generate lesson materials that lack conceptual depth, contain mathematical inaccuracies, and fail to reflect research-based teaching practices. \xa0We address this through developing domain-specific AI algorithms that integrate proven mathematical frameworks and are guided by mathematics educators\' expertise, ensuring content maintains both academic rigor and pedagogical effectiveness. Second, while AI can streamline lesson planning, it\'s crucial to enhance rather than replace teacher creativity and professional judgment, especially when adapting materials for diverse student needs. Our solution involves implementing quality measures and tooling that supports teachers in iteratively refining AI-generated content, ensuring they maintain creative control while benefiting from AI assistance. Initial Findings: Our initial implementation studies of Colleague AI\'s tools in math education have yielded promising preliminary results. Early qualitative data show teachers find Colleague AI generated lesson plans to be much more education-focused and responsive to specific instructional needs than generic LLM-based applications. One teacher found “with this tool, the generated lesson plan doesn’t need a whole rewrite - it’s only modification of small pieces.” Educators have observed substantial improvement in the efficiency and perceived efficacy of their lesson planning assisted by Colleague AI. The real time interactive capabilities of the platform allow teachers to iterate and refine the lesson plans much more efficiently; one teacher noted “my math expertise now matters ... AI generates an engaging math activity, giving me a starting point. It literally takes seconds to generate, rather than the 30 or 40 minutes it would have taken me to design the activity myself.” When comparing human expert generated lesson plans to an early version of Colleague AI generated plans in middle grades, teacher raters had a slight overall preference for human designed lesson plans, but educators are increasingly accepting AI-generated lesson plans that leverage subject-specific training data and pedagogical expertise.

We are leveraging a low-cost embedded system (the AHA! board) and edge intelligence (Artificial Intelligence performed on local devices rather than in the cloud) to engage students and teachers from under-resourced communities in the design and creative application of smart, embedded technologies while scaffolding their engineering identity development to prepare them for the STEM jobs of tomorrow. Specifically, we are using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to teach microelectronics and AI as it runs on stand-alone, low-cost microcontroller boards with extensive hardware abstraction, minimizing the barrier of integrating ML applications with hardware. Important to our approach, TinyML applications are robust enough to be used as solutions to real-world problems such as monitoring of local air quality, traffic safety, or physiology and health. Designing, deploying, and managing TinyML applications on microcontrollers exposes students to full-stack development skills that will be important both in college and in their future jobs because these skills apply to working with large-scale ML technologies and applications. Because TinyML does not require large amounts of data and model training employs straightforward procedures, this approach is accessible to students with low prior knowledge of ML, expanding their conceptions of AI to include hardware and sensor-based applications and illustrating responsible and ethical uses of AI. Challenges Related to AI Use in Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: Access to affordable hardware, software, and datasets for demystifying integration of computer science and engineering, and the applications of AI beyond chatbots and LLMs. Solution: We have created an innovative embedded system that integrates 6 sensors and an inexpensive but powerful microcontroller to design and deploy community-relevant edge AI applications. Students learn about computer science, microelectronics engineering, and edge intelligence in an integrated way. Approahces to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: We are co-designing and testing the curriculum as a research-practice partnership with 8 high school computer science and engineering teachers from FL, TX and KS. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: Educators and educational scholars should expand the focus of AI education beyond NLP and LLM focused applications such as chatbots and integrate hardware-focused AI approaches such as edge intelligence or computer vision-focused approaches such as image classification. Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: Our main advice is to focus more on the concepts and applications and less on the procedural aspects of the implementation. This approach will help create and sustain situational interest among students. Initial Findings: Currently in our initial project phase, we began co-designing the AHA! curriculum. Our five-module curriculum is intended to be taught in a flexible manner over 15 hours of instructional time. It leverages experiential hands-on learning using large coded datasets. We also constructed a more expansive and affordable AHA! Board. Our planning process includes brainstorming to create datasets to engage users with using multimodal sensing and components of the AHA! Board to solve real-world problems for social good (e.g., motion sensing, heart-rate monitoring). Products: Ramirez-Salgado, A., & Antonenko, P. (2024, June).

Learning progressions are cognitive models that are based on a developmental approach to learning. The AI scoring system will offer cognitive, tailored feedback to students based on their responses and provide teachers with class summaries. Such tools support formative assessment within high school physical science that meets the Next Generation Science Standards\' performance expectations, aimed at enhancing student learning. The AI system uses natural language processing, image recognition, and supervised machine learning to evaluate students\' written explanations and digitally created models. The feedback is tailored to the learning progression and delivered according to the AI\'s classification of the responses. The study assesses whether this automated feedback enhances students\' learning outcomes and their progression regarding electrical interactions. Additionally, the project fosters scientific knowledge by involving students in scientific practices like modeling, connecting core disciplinary concepts, and using crosscutting ideas to analyze compelling phenomena, with real-time feedback provided throughout the process. Challenges Related to AI Use in Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: One of the important challenges we have faced in the current project is simultaneous analysis of student performance on multi-modal assessments aligned to a knowledge-in-use LP. An example of an LP-aligned multi-modal assessment item is asking students to develop a scientific model explaining an electrostatic phenomenon and write a short accompanying explanation reflecting their reasoning. Such assessments are challenging to evaluate using AI due to the need to simultaneously evaluate the model, the explanation, and make a decision on final LP-level placement. Moreover, the resulting feedback should provide productive and constructive comments to specific ideas present in the student response in order to support the student developing more sophisticated understanding as described by the LP. In the current project, we have evaluated the two modalities separately using AI, and then humans make decisions regarding the final LP level placement and feedback based on the two modalities. In the future, we hope to explore multimodal AI analysis, as this will better align with the assessment tasks for \xa0knowledge-in-use. Initial Findings: We have designed and tested a learning progression guided approach to training AI algorithms to evaluate complex science understanding reflective of knowledge-in-use in different modalities: text-based explanations and drawing-based scientific models. Preliminary results indicate that this approach helps develop rubrics for human and AI-based scoring that yield high human-human and human-AI agreement on both modalities. These results suggest promise in training AI algorithms to evaluate complex reasoning and skills in a way that is grounded in relevant, empirically validated learning theories, reflecting human-in-the loop approach to AI training.

Project Description: We have been developing and researching Intelligent Science Stations, a new genre of interactive science experiences that add an AI layer on top of physical experimentation to improve children’s STEM learning and engagement. The motivation behind this project is the need for engaging, inquiry-based science learning opportunities for young children in the classroom, to sustain early interest in science. The Intelligent Science Stations provides students with hands-on science experiences, augmented by an intelligent agent that offers feedback based on artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision. These Intelligent Science Stations incorporate scientific apparatuses such as earthquake tables, ramps or balance scales, and students\' actions are observed and evaluated by the intelligent agent. The agent appears as an animated character on a screen and provides interactive feedback and guidance to guide students through scientific inquiry. This innovative approach offers evidence-based, personalized support and feedback to children, while also assisting teachers in integrating more inquiry-based science learning into their classrooms. By modeling behaviors like asking questions, making predictions, and explaining scientific phenomena, the interactive AI system helps teachers enhance their classroom experiences. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: Based on our research, we have seen that many teachers, especially in elementary school, don’t have a science background so are afraid to teach science concepts. They want technologies that support them together with the children. Here is what one of the teachers said after seeing our system: “I love that NoRILLA uses technology in such an engaging, communicative and non-isolating way. I\'m not a scientist, I\'m not a scientist by any stretch of imagination and I love science and I love to teach science, but I feel like I\'m limited by own limitations in the science world. To have something like this that supports and backs up and lets the kids and myself all learn together is genius!" Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: We believe good partnerships and diverse perspectives are instrumental to success. We try to partner with many organizations from different perspectives and we prioritize their needs to make sure our technologies and curriculum can be integrated in the real-world seamlessly. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: I believe advanced technologies and AI have great potential to improve children\'s learning and engagement in the classroom if used in the right way. I think it\'s important to use technology in a creative way to get children to think critically rather than memorizing facts or pressing buttons. Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: I think it\'s important to leverage AI in a way that\'s not isolating but instead more collaborative, in a way that brings people together rather than bringing them apart. It\'s also crucial to have an evidence-based approach to build technologies that are scientifically proven to be effective in the real-world. Initial Findings: Early research has shown that AI-enhanced intelligent science stations improve children’s STEM learning by 5 times compared to other screen-based technologies. Also, adding an AI-based guided inquiry layer on top of physical experimentation improves children’s learning and engagement dramatically compared to traditional maker spaces and hands-on exhibits (4x dwell time). Our recent research in schools has shown that children’s informed decision making and deep understanding of standards-aligned STEM concepts doubled in one year using NoRILLA Intelligent Science Stations. We also saw that there was a 32% increase in students’ ability to Explain their answers, which relates to Higher Level Thinking as highlighted in NGSS and common core standards. Looking at grades separately, we saw that a kindergartner interacting with NoRILLA for 3 months significantly exceeded the scientific understanding of a second grader (3 times the natural yearly progression).

Interactive, Individualized Professional Learning for Elementary School Teachers: Enhancing Content and Pedagogical Content Knowledge as a Basis for Improving Practice PI : Yasemin Copur-Gencturk | Co-PIs: Ken Frank , Jiliang Tang Disciplines: Mathematics Grade Levels: Elementary school teachers and their students Role of AI: Supporting STEM Teaching AI Tools: We are developing a new AI tool to create a scalable, real-time and personalized professional development program that offers teachers interactive learning opportunities to enhance their knowledge of teaching numbers and operations. Unlike many generative AI tools, our approach uses AI to foster an active learning environment in which AI acts as a facilitator for teacher learning. This means that teachers construct their own understanding through engaging specially designed activities tailored to their needs while the AI analyzes their responses, provides feedback, and offers additional learning opportunities in areas where further support is needed. Project Description: Students learn more mathematics when their teachers are knowledgeable about the content and how best to teach that content to a range of students. As a result, teachers, like other professionals, need continuing support and training to be most effective. Unfortunately, that training is not always available -- teachers may have scheduling constraints that limit their opportunities to access support, or there may not be enough experts in their district to support them. Therefore, this project will develop AI support for teachers’ mathematics instruction. Once developed and adapted to context, the AI can draw on expert knowledge to support teachers on their schedules \xa0 Specifically, we are creating a content-focused, interactive, and scaled professional development program to facilitate teachers’ learning through mimicking human facilitators. The AI analyzes teachers’ responses, identifies areas that need further support, and provides follow-up learning opportunities, depending on the teachers’ needs. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: The most significant challenge we face in this area is the limited incorporation of research on teaching and learning into the development of tools that leverage AI. The lack of attention to effective teaching and learning conditions in the design of these tools hinders their ability to promote meaningful learning, as they often replicate mistakes made in the past. For instance, these tools are typically designed to deliver information rather than provide opportunities to foster higher-order thinking skills. Our solution is to develop tools informed by existing research on what makes professional development effective for teachers and to find ways to design AI systems that support this goal. Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: Close collaboration between content and AI experts during the design phase of AI tools is essential for developing tools that have a meaningful impact on STEM teaching, learning, and research. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: One goal is to create accessible and personalized professional learning opportunities for teachers, with the potential to enhance teaching and learning on a large scale. Another significant implication lies in educational research because part of our aim is to enhance the ability of AI to understand the qualitative nuances in teachers’ knowledge and skills that only experts can detect. The advances we make in this area could be extended to automate data coding at scale, and enabling the capture of meaningful differences in teaching and learning. In fact, we are currently exploring the potential of AI in this regard: Can AI be trained to identify qualitative nuances in knowledge and skills as effectively as experts in the field? Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: We suggest focusing on the content being covered and the types of learning opportunities provided to build understanding. We have observed that some tools are not aligned with research on effective and meaningful STEM learning, which can potentially do more harm than good. \xa0We also recommend building an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and math educators, each of whom knows how to speak the other’s language enough to pursue shared goals. Initial Findings: We are currently identifying the foundational concepts central to numbers and operations, along with common learning patterns exhibited by students and evidence-based practices and representations that support deeper student understanding of these concepts. Additionally, we are exploring how to set clear learning goals for these activities so that AI can fully comprehend and leverage them for teachers’ professional development. Our efforts are focused on system design and developing ways for AI to capture the nuances in teachers’ responses. We are also working to identify accurate and efficient methods to assess teachers’ understanding. Products: The prototype of our work, including how we develop the content for these programs and integrate educational technology, can be found here . It is important to note that this project leverages more advanced technologies, pushing the boundaries in both education and AI. Our efforts focus on creating interactive and personalized learning environments that foster the development of higher order thinking skills.

STEM Teaching : AI tools provide teachers with data-driven insights to enhance instructional decision-making. STEM Learning : Students benefit from personalized feedback generated by AI-based scoring systems, which helps identify strengths and areas for improvement. AI Tools: Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to score open-ended assessment item and integrating automated scoring systems with instructional dashboards for educators Project Description: The PASTA (Providing Automated Scoring for Three-dimensional Assessments) project explores the potential of AI to revolutionize science education by leveraging automated scoring systems for three-dimensional assessments. These assessments align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and focus on integrating disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts. Using advanced natural language processing techniques, the project has developed AI models that accurately and timely score open-ended student responses, providing teachers with actionable feedback. By embedding these tools into user-friendly dashboards, the project empowers educators to make data-informed instructional decisions, ultimately enhancing the teaching and learning process. The PASTA project aims to bridge the gap between assessment and instruction by enabling real-time feedback, fostering equity in science education, and supporting differentiated instruction tailored to individual student needs. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: One key challenge is managing unbalanced training data for developing automatic models. To address this, the project explored data augmentation strategies to enhance model performance. Another challenge involves the large size of LLMs, which consume costly resources. The project studied this issue by using knowledge distillation to reduce model size while maintaining effectiveness. Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: Collaborations with teachers, assessment experts, and AI researchers have been instrumental in designing tools that are both technically robust and pedagogically meaningful. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: The integration of AI-powered adaptive learning systems that provide personalized recommendations for instructional strategies based on assessment data.

Using Natural Language Processing to Inform Science Instruction: Technologies to Inform Practices in Science (TIPS) Figure 1. A sample TIPS adaptive dialog embedded in a web-based inquiry science unit on Plate Tectonics PIs : Marcia Linn ,\xa0Lei Liu | Co-PIs: Libby Gerard , Quang Hoang Disciplines: Earth Science, Life Science, Physical Science, Engineering Grade Levels: 6-12 Role of AI: Supporting Research/Analyses, STEM Teaching, STEM Learning AI Tools: Software Tools: TIPS uses NLP idea detection models to identify each idea in a student explanation. TIPS partners compose pedagogically informed prompts for each idea to guide the student to link their idea to a new idea. The TIPS Dialog uses the NLP to detect student ideas in real time and assigns one of the partner-authored prompts. Rather than only addressing frequent ideas, TIPS affirms and builds on each student’s ideas. TIPS leverages industry-standard, open-source AI tools and frameworks, including Hugging Face, PyTorch, and Weights & Biases (W&B), to facilitate the development, monitoring, and training of our Natural Language Processing (NLP) neural network models. For deployment, we utilize robust cloud-based tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as EC2 and SageMaker, ensuring scalable and efficient operationalization of our models. TIPS AI Dialog. We exploit NLP to identify each student’s science ideas in their written explanation in response to a knowledge integration question about an NGSS topic. For example, one question in a unit on photosynthesis asks students to write a story about how animals use energy from the sun. Our NLP model can detect about 25 different student science ideas within their written responses. Students often express ideas both from instruction and ideas from their own experiences. We designed an adaptive Dialog that uses the NLP idea detection and embedded the dialog in web-based inquiry science units. The tool uses knowledge integration pedagogy to engage the student in a personalized dialog to integrate their specific detected ideas about the topic. An avatar detects each student’s initial ideas, asks questions tailored to the student’s ideas, and helps the student generate a more coherent and accurate science explanation. We designed the NLP idea detection models and dialog guidance in partnership with local middle and high school science teachers to ensure that the models are detecting the full range of student ideas they hear in the classroom. Our recent findings demonstrate that the chatbot can improve students’ science understanding. Students like the chatbot and want the conversation about their science ideas to continue. Check out recent findings below! AI Peer Chat. We also utilize NLP idea detection technology in an online peer chat tool. We designed the tool in partnership with middle school teachers and have embedded it in two web-based inquiry science units such as Plate Tectonics and Photosynthesis. The tool pairs students so that they can chat about their ideas about a focal science topic. The peer chat tool uses the same NLP technology described above to recognize students’ ideas and adaptively pair them based on parameters set by researchers or teachers. For example, a recent study paired students to maximize the number of different ideas students expressed between them (Billings et al., 2024). Students can also be paired based on KI score using previously developed KI scoring NLP models. We are currently working on additional adaptive pairing strategies, including pairing students based on specific ideas they express in their explanations. The peer chat also provides students with adaptive question bank prompts to help facilitate their online discussion. The prompts are assigned to student pairs based on the ideas detected in each of the student’s explanations using NLP. Students can use the question bank prompts in the chat environment to help facilitate and inspire their discussion. Findings from a recent study indicated that the adaptive question bank was used effectively by students and students were more likely to use the NLP adaptive prompts than generic prompts (Billings et al., 2024). Project Description: Technologies to Inform Practices in Science (TIPS) uses AI to build integrated understanding by guiding students to elaborate their explanations of complex scientific phenomena. We implement peer conversations and adaptive dialogs that prompt students to make their explanations more coherent. We embed the AI dialogs in interactive, web-based units featuring models of the scientific topic, hands-on activities, and projects. TIPS uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) idea detection models to identify each idea in a student explanation. The models meet industry standards for human-machine agreement. TIPS partners compose pedagogically informed prompts for each idea. The embedded dialog detects student ideas in real time and assigns one of the prompts (see Figure). Rather than only addressing frequent ideas, dialogs affirm and build on each student’s ideas, consistent with knowledge integration pedagogy. To minimize possible bias in NLP idea detection towards Eurocentric culture, in partnership with teachers, we build the models using responses of students with similar demographics to student users in future science classes. The partner teachers’ schools serve a majority of students from underrepresented groups in STEM. We show that AI can improve peer conversations and adaptive dialogs that promote students’ science understanding. Adding dialogs to inquiry science units, enables students to consider more and better ideas in their explanations and make more productive revisions to their thinking. The adaptive dialog engages students from both monolingual English and multilingual backgrounds in adding relevant ideas while revising their explanations. Students like participating in dialogs and want the conversation about their science ideas to continue. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education: Building educationally valid models Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: Research Practice Partnership where each partner respects the expertise of the other partners and commits to learn from each other. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: Personalizing interactions with students, informed by advances in pedagogy. Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: Build on the work of others, create and use open source materials. Connect innovation with powerful pedagogy to amplify impacts and outcomes. Initial Findings: Our recent findings demonstrate that the AI dialog can improve students’ science understanding. Students like the dialog and want the conversation about their science ideas to continue. The adaptive dialog engages students from both monolingual English and multilingual backgrounds in incorporating additional relevant ideas into their explanations, resulting in a significant improvement in student responses from initial to revised explanations. The guidance supports students in both language groups to progress in integrating their scientific ideas. TIPS NLP models achieve industry-standard human-machine agreement.

The platform leverages semantic search, recommender systems, and content generation capabilities to help teachers modify and create engaging mathematics lessons. By focusing specifically on middle-grade mathematics, where content complexity increases and teacher support is crucial, Colleague AI helps ensure materials maintain mathematical accuracy while supporting different learning styles and ability levels. This integration of educational expertise with AI technology aims to address the unique challenges of middle-grade mathematics instruction. The platform supports teachers in creating research-based, standards-aligned lessons while reducing preparation time, particularly benefiting early-career teachers and those serving diverse student populations. Through this focused approach, Colleague AI works to improve both teaching effectiveness and student mathematical achievement. Challenges Related to AI Use in Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: In our experience implementing AI solutions in middle-grade math education, two \xa0significant challenges emerge in applying AI to mathematics education. First, general-purpose AI tools often generate lesson materials that lack conceptual depth, contain mathematical inaccuracies, and fail to reflect research-based teaching practices. \xa0We address this through developing domain-specific AI algorithms that integrate proven mathematical frameworks and are guided by mathematics educators\' expertise, ensuring content maintains both academic rigor and pedagogical effectiveness. Second, while AI can streamline lesson planning, it\'s crucial to enhance rather than replace teacher creativity and professional judgment, especially when adapting materials for diverse student needs. Our solution involves implementing quality measures and tooling that supports teachers in iteratively refining AI-generated content, ensuring they maintain creative control while benefiting from AI assistance. Initial Findings: Our initial implementation studies of Colleague AI\'s tools in math education have yielded promising preliminary results. Early qualitative data show teachers find Colleague AI generated lesson plans to be much more education-focused and responsive to specific instructional needs than generic LLM-based applications. One teacher found “with this tool, the generated lesson plan doesn’t need a whole rewrite - it’s only modification of small pieces.” Educators have observed substantial improvement in the efficiency and perceived efficacy of their lesson planning assisted by Colleague AI. The real time interactive capabilities of the platform allow teachers to iterate and refine the lesson plans much more efficiently; one teacher noted “my math expertise now matters ... AI generates an engaging math activity, giving me a starting point. It literally takes seconds to generate, rather than the 30 or 40 minutes it would have taken me to design the activity myself.” When comparing human expert generated lesson plans to an early version of Colleague AI generated plans in middle grades, teacher raters had a slight overall preference for human designed lesson plans, but educators are increasingly accepting AI-generated lesson plans that leverage subject-specific training data and pedagogical expertise.

We are leveraging a low-cost embedded system (the AHA! board) and edge intelligence (Artificial Intelligence performed on local devices rather than in the cloud) to engage students and teachers from under-resourced communities in the design and creative application of smart, embedded technologies while scaffolding their engineering identity development to prepare them for the STEM jobs of tomorrow. Specifically, we are using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to teach microelectronics and AI as it runs on stand-alone, low-cost microcontroller boards with extensive hardware abstraction, minimizing the barrier of integrating ML applications with hardware. Important to our approach, TinyML applications are robust enough to be used as solutions to real-world problems such as monitoring of local air quality, traffic safety, or physiology and health. Designing, deploying, and managing TinyML applications on microcontrollers exposes students to full-stack development skills that will be important both in college and in their future jobs because these skills apply to working with large-scale ML technologies and applications. Because TinyML does not require large amounts of data and model training employs straightforward procedures, this approach is accessible to students with low prior knowledge of ML, expanding their conceptions of AI to include hardware and sensor-based applications and illustrating responsible and ethical uses of AI. Challenges Related to AI Use in Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: Access to affordable hardware, software, and datasets for demystifying integration of computer science and engineering, and the applications of AI beyond chatbots and LLMs. Solution: We have created an innovative embedded system that integrates 6 sensors and an inexpensive but powerful microcontroller to design and deploy community-relevant edge AI applications. Students learn about computer science, microelectronics engineering, and edge intelligence in an integrated way. Approahces to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: We are co-designing and testing the curriculum as a research-practice partnership with 8 high school computer science and engineering teachers from FL, TX and KS. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: Educators and educational scholars should expand the focus of AI education beyond NLP and LLM focused applications such as chatbots and integrate hardware-focused AI approaches such as edge intelligence or computer vision-focused approaches such as image classification. Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: Our main advice is to focus more on the concepts and applications and less on the procedural aspects of the implementation. This approach will help create and sustain situational interest among students. Initial Findings: Currently in our initial project phase, we began co-designing the AHA! curriculum. Our five-module curriculum is intended to be taught in a flexible manner over 15 hours of instructional time. It leverages experiential hands-on learning using large coded datasets. We also constructed a more expansive and affordable AHA! Board. Our planning process includes brainstorming to create datasets to engage users with using multimodal sensing and components of the AHA! Board to solve real-world problems for social good (e.g., motion sensing, heart-rate monitoring). Products: Ramirez-Salgado, A., & Antonenko, P. (2024, June).

Learning progressions are cognitive models that are based on a developmental approach to learning. The AI scoring system will offer cognitive, tailored feedback to students based on their responses and provide teachers with class summaries. Such tools support formative assessment within high school physical science that meets the Next Generation Science Standards\' performance expectations, aimed at enhancing student learning. The AI system uses natural language processing, image recognition, and supervised machine learning to evaluate students\' written explanations and digitally created models. The feedback is tailored to the learning progression and delivered according to the AI\'s classification of the responses. The study assesses whether this automated feedback enhances students\' learning outcomes and their progression regarding electrical interactions. Additionally, the project fosters scientific knowledge by involving students in scientific practices like modeling, connecting core disciplinary concepts, and using crosscutting ideas to analyze compelling phenomena, with real-time feedback provided throughout the process. Challenges Related to AI Use in Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: One of the important challenges we have faced in the current project is simultaneous analysis of student performance on multi-modal assessments aligned to a knowledge-in-use LP. An example of an LP-aligned multi-modal assessment item is asking students to develop a scientific model explaining an electrostatic phenomenon and write a short accompanying explanation reflecting their reasoning. Such assessments are challenging to evaluate using AI due to the need to simultaneously evaluate the model, the explanation, and make a decision on final LP-level placement. Moreover, the resulting feedback should provide productive and constructive comments to specific ideas present in the student response in order to support the student developing more sophisticated understanding as described by the LP. In the current project, we have evaluated the two modalities separately using AI, and then humans make decisions regarding the final LP level placement and feedback based on the two modalities. In the future, we hope to explore multimodal AI analysis, as this will better align with the assessment tasks for \xa0knowledge-in-use. Initial Findings: We have designed and tested a learning progression guided approach to training AI algorithms to evaluate complex science understanding reflective of knowledge-in-use in different modalities: text-based explanations and drawing-based scientific models. Preliminary results indicate that this approach helps develop rubrics for human and AI-based scoring that yield high human-human and human-AI agreement on both modalities. These results suggest promise in training AI algorithms to evaluate complex reasoning and skills in a way that is grounded in relevant, empirically validated learning theories, reflecting human-in-the loop approach to AI training.

Project Description: We have been developing and researching Intelligent Science Stations, a new genre of interactive science experiences that add an AI layer on top of physical experimentation to improve children’s STEM learning and engagement. The motivation behind this project is the need for engaging, inquiry-based science learning opportunities for young children in the classroom, to sustain early interest in science. The Intelligent Science Stations provides students with hands-on science experiences, augmented by an intelligent agent that offers feedback based on artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision. These Intelligent Science Stations incorporate scientific apparatuses such as earthquake tables, ramps or balance scales, and students\' actions are observed and evaluated by the intelligent agent. The agent appears as an animated character on a screen and provides interactive feedback and guidance to guide students through scientific inquiry. This innovative approach offers evidence-based, personalized support and feedback to children, while also assisting teachers in integrating more inquiry-based science learning into their classrooms. By modeling behaviors like asking questions, making predictions, and explaining scientific phenomena, the interactive AI system helps teachers enhance their classroom experiences. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: Based on our research, we have seen that many teachers, especially in elementary school, don’t have a science background so are afraid to teach science concepts. They want technologies that support them together with the children. Here is what one of the teachers said after seeing our system: “I love that NoRILLA uses technology in such an engaging, communicative and non-isolating way. I\'m not a scientist, I\'m not a scientist by any stretch of imagination and I love science and I love to teach science, but I feel like I\'m limited by own limitations in the science world. To have something like this that supports and backs up and lets the kids and myself all learn together is genius!" Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: We believe good partnerships and diverse perspectives are instrumental to success. We try to partner with many organizations from different perspectives and we prioritize their needs to make sure our technologies and curriculum can be integrated in the real-world seamlessly. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: I believe advanced technologies and AI have great potential to improve children\'s learning and engagement in the classroom if used in the right way. I think it\'s important to use technology in a creative way to get children to think critically rather than memorizing facts or pressing buttons. Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: I think it\'s important to leverage AI in a way that\'s not isolating but instead more collaborative, in a way that brings people together rather than bringing them apart. It\'s also crucial to have an evidence-based approach to build technologies that are scientifically proven to be effective in the real-world. Initial Findings: Early research has shown that AI-enhanced intelligent science stations improve children’s STEM learning by 5 times compared to other screen-based technologies. Also, adding an AI-based guided inquiry layer on top of physical experimentation improves children’s learning and engagement dramatically compared to traditional maker spaces and hands-on exhibits (4x dwell time). Our recent research in schools has shown that children’s informed decision making and deep understanding of standards-aligned STEM concepts doubled in one year using NoRILLA Intelligent Science Stations. We also saw that there was a 32% increase in students’ ability to Explain their answers, which relates to Higher Level Thinking as highlighted in NGSS and common core standards. Looking at grades separately, we saw that a kindergartner interacting with NoRILLA for 3 months significantly exceeded the scientific understanding of a second grader (3 times the natural yearly progression).

Interactive, Individualized Professional Learning for Elementary School Teachers: Enhancing Content and Pedagogical Content Knowledge as a Basis for Improving Practice PI : Yasemin Copur-Gencturk | Co-PIs: Ken Frank , Jiliang Tang Disciplines: Mathematics Grade Levels: Elementary school teachers and their students Role of AI: Supporting STEM Teaching AI Tools: We are developing a new AI tool to create a scalable, real-time and personalized professional development program that offers teachers interactive learning opportunities to enhance their knowledge of teaching numbers and operations. Unlike many generative AI tools, our approach uses AI to foster an active learning environment in which AI acts as a facilitator for teacher learning. This means that teachers construct their own understanding through engaging specially designed activities tailored to their needs while the AI analyzes their responses, provides feedback, and offers additional learning opportunities in areas where further support is needed. Project Description: Students learn more mathematics when their teachers are knowledgeable about the content and how best to teach that content to a range of students. As a result, teachers, like other professionals, need continuing support and training to be most effective. Unfortunately, that training is not always available -- teachers may have scheduling constraints that limit their opportunities to access support, or there may not be enough experts in their district to support them. Therefore, this project will develop AI support for teachers’ mathematics instruction. Once developed and adapted to context, the AI can draw on expert knowledge to support teachers on their schedules \xa0 Specifically, we are creating a content-focused, interactive, and scaled professional development program to facilitate teachers’ learning through mimicking human facilitators. The AI analyzes teachers’ responses, identifies areas that need further support, and provides follow-up learning opportunities, depending on the teachers’ needs. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: The most significant challenge we face in this area is the limited incorporation of research on teaching and learning into the development of tools that leverage AI. The lack of attention to effective teaching and learning conditions in the design of these tools hinders their ability to promote meaningful learning, as they often replicate mistakes made in the past. For instance, these tools are typically designed to deliver information rather than provide opportunities to foster higher-order thinking skills. Our solution is to develop tools informed by existing research on what makes professional development effective for teachers and to find ways to design AI systems that support this goal. Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: Close collaboration between content and AI experts during the design phase of AI tools is essential for developing tools that have a meaningful impact on STEM teaching, learning, and research. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: One goal is to create accessible and personalized professional learning opportunities for teachers, with the potential to enhance teaching and learning on a large scale. Another significant implication lies in educational research because part of our aim is to enhance the ability of AI to understand the qualitative nuances in teachers’ knowledge and skills that only experts can detect. The advances we make in this area could be extended to automate data coding at scale, and enabling the capture of meaningful differences in teaching and learning. In fact, we are currently exploring the potential of AI in this regard: Can AI be trained to identify qualitative nuances in knowledge and skills as effectively as experts in the field? Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: We suggest focusing on the content being covered and the types of learning opportunities provided to build understanding. We have observed that some tools are not aligned with research on effective and meaningful STEM learning, which can potentially do more harm than good. \xa0We also recommend building an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and math educators, each of whom knows how to speak the other’s language enough to pursue shared goals. Initial Findings: We are currently identifying the foundational concepts central to numbers and operations, along with common learning patterns exhibited by students and evidence-based practices and representations that support deeper student understanding of these concepts. Additionally, we are exploring how to set clear learning goals for these activities so that AI can fully comprehend and leverage them for teachers’ professional development. Our efforts are focused on system design and developing ways for AI to capture the nuances in teachers’ responses. We are also working to identify accurate and efficient methods to assess teachers’ understanding. Products: The prototype of our work, including how we develop the content for these programs and integrate educational technology, can be found here . It is important to note that this project leverages more advanced technologies, pushing the boundaries in both education and AI. Our efforts focus on creating interactive and personalized learning environments that foster the development of higher order thinking skills.

STEM Teaching : AI tools provide teachers with data-driven insights to enhance instructional decision-making. STEM Learning : Students benefit from personalized feedback generated by AI-based scoring systems, which helps identify strengths and areas for improvement. AI Tools: Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to score open-ended assessment item and integrating automated scoring systems with instructional dashboards for educators Project Description: The PASTA (Providing Automated Scoring for Three-dimensional Assessments) project explores the potential of AI to revolutionize science education by leveraging automated scoring systems for three-dimensional assessments. These assessments align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and focus on integrating disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts. Using advanced natural language processing techniques, the project has developed AI models that accurately and timely score open-ended student responses, providing teachers with actionable feedback. By embedding these tools into user-friendly dashboards, the project empowers educators to make data-informed instructional decisions, ultimately enhancing the teaching and learning process. The PASTA project aims to bridge the gap between assessment and instruction by enabling real-time feedback, fostering equity in science education, and supporting differentiated instruction tailored to individual student needs. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education and Strategies for Addressing Them: One key challenge is managing unbalanced training data for developing automatic models. To address this, the project explored data augmentation strategies to enhance model performance. Another challenge involves the large size of LLMs, which consume costly resources. The project studied this issue by using knowledge distillation to reduce model size while maintaining effectiveness. Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: Collaborations with teachers, assessment experts, and AI researchers have been instrumental in designing tools that are both technically robust and pedagogically meaningful. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: The integration of AI-powered adaptive learning systems that provide personalized recommendations for instructional strategies based on assessment data.

Using Natural Language Processing to Inform Science Instruction: Technologies to Inform Practices in Science (TIPS) Figure 1. A sample TIPS adaptive dialog embedded in a web-based inquiry science unit on Plate Tectonics PIs : Marcia Linn ,\xa0Lei Liu | Co-PIs: Libby Gerard , Quang Hoang Disciplines: Earth Science, Life Science, Physical Science, Engineering Grade Levels: 6-12 Role of AI: Supporting Research/Analyses, STEM Teaching, STEM Learning AI Tools: Software Tools: TIPS uses NLP idea detection models to identify each idea in a student explanation. TIPS partners compose pedagogically informed prompts for each idea to guide the student to link their idea to a new idea. The TIPS Dialog uses the NLP to detect student ideas in real time and assigns one of the partner-authored prompts. Rather than only addressing frequent ideas, TIPS affirms and builds on each student’s ideas. TIPS leverages industry-standard, open-source AI tools and frameworks, including Hugging Face, PyTorch, and Weights & Biases (W&B), to facilitate the development, monitoring, and training of our Natural Language Processing (NLP) neural network models. For deployment, we utilize robust cloud-based tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as EC2 and SageMaker, ensuring scalable and efficient operationalization of our models. TIPS AI Dialog. We exploit NLP to identify each student’s science ideas in their written explanation in response to a knowledge integration question about an NGSS topic. For example, one question in a unit on photosynthesis asks students to write a story about how animals use energy from the sun. Our NLP model can detect about 25 different student science ideas within their written responses. Students often express ideas both from instruction and ideas from their own experiences. We designed an adaptive Dialog that uses the NLP idea detection and embedded the dialog in web-based inquiry science units. The tool uses knowledge integration pedagogy to engage the student in a personalized dialog to integrate their specific detected ideas about the topic. An avatar detects each student’s initial ideas, asks questions tailored to the student’s ideas, and helps the student generate a more coherent and accurate science explanation. We designed the NLP idea detection models and dialog guidance in partnership with local middle and high school science teachers to ensure that the models are detecting the full range of student ideas they hear in the classroom. Our recent findings demonstrate that the chatbot can improve students’ science understanding. Students like the chatbot and want the conversation about their science ideas to continue. Check out recent findings below! AI Peer Chat. We also utilize NLP idea detection technology in an online peer chat tool. We designed the tool in partnership with middle school teachers and have embedded it in two web-based inquiry science units such as Plate Tectonics and Photosynthesis. The tool pairs students so that they can chat about their ideas about a focal science topic. The peer chat tool uses the same NLP technology described above to recognize students’ ideas and adaptively pair them based on parameters set by researchers or teachers. For example, a recent study paired students to maximize the number of different ideas students expressed between them (Billings et al., 2024). Students can also be paired based on KI score using previously developed KI scoring NLP models. We are currently working on additional adaptive pairing strategies, including pairing students based on specific ideas they express in their explanations. The peer chat also provides students with adaptive question bank prompts to help facilitate their online discussion. The prompts are assigned to student pairs based on the ideas detected in each of the student’s explanations using NLP. Students can use the question bank prompts in the chat environment to help facilitate and inspire their discussion. Findings from a recent study indicated that the adaptive question bank was used effectively by students and students were more likely to use the NLP adaptive prompts than generic prompts (Billings et al., 2024). Project Description: Technologies to Inform Practices in Science (TIPS) uses AI to build integrated understanding by guiding students to elaborate their explanations of complex scientific phenomena. We implement peer conversations and adaptive dialogs that prompt students to make their explanations more coherent. We embed the AI dialogs in interactive, web-based units featuring models of the scientific topic, hands-on activities, and projects. TIPS uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) idea detection models to identify each idea in a student explanation. The models meet industry standards for human-machine agreement. TIPS partners compose pedagogically informed prompts for each idea. The embedded dialog detects student ideas in real time and assigns one of the prompts (see Figure). Rather than only addressing frequent ideas, dialogs affirm and build on each student’s ideas, consistent with knowledge integration pedagogy. To minimize possible bias in NLP idea detection towards Eurocentric culture, in partnership with teachers, we build the models using responses of students with similar demographics to student users in future science classes. The partner teachers’ schools serve a majority of students from underrepresented groups in STEM. We show that AI can improve peer conversations and adaptive dialogs that promote students’ science understanding. Adding dialogs to inquiry science units, enables students to consider more and better ideas in their explanations and make more productive revisions to their thinking. The adaptive dialog engages students from both monolingual English and multilingual backgrounds in adding relevant ideas while revising their explanations. Students like participating in dialogs and want the conversation about their science ideas to continue. Challenges Related to AI Use in STEM Education: Building educationally valid models Approaches to Partnership, Project Design, and/or Collaboration: Research Practice Partnership where each partner respects the expertise of the other partners and commits to learn from each other. Opportunities for AI Use in STEM Education Research: Personalizing interactions with students, informed by advances in pedagogy. Advice for Others Considering AI Use in STEM Education Research: Build on the work of others, create and use open source materials. Connect innovation with powerful pedagogy to amplify impacts and outcomes. Initial Findings: Our recent findings demonstrate that the AI dialog can improve students’ science understanding. Students like the dialog and want the conversation about their science ideas to continue. The adaptive dialog engages students from both monolingual English and multilingual backgrounds in incorporating additional relevant ideas into their explanations, resulting in a significant improvement in student responses from initial to revised explanations. The guidance supports students in both language groups to progress in integrating their scientific ideas. TIPS NLP models achieve industry-standard human-machine agreement.
